This is the latest version of The Gossip Project app.

We used a real database with SQL.

These are the following commands to try it:

1 - open your command line (terminal)

2 - go into the file

3 - run 'bundle install'

4 - run 'rails db:migrate'

5 - run 'rails db:migrate:status' to check if the migrations are "up"

6 - run 'rails s' to launch a server

7 - open your browser and copy the following url: http://localhost:3000/static_pages/home

8 - navigate and check if the exercices have been made properly.
